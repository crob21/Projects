# This is a placeholder for the PNG version of the LINE WALRUS logo
# In production, you would convert the SVG to PNG using a tool like:
# - Online SVG to PNG converter
# - Image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Figma
# - Command line tools like ImageMagick or Inkscape
#
# The PNG should be 120x120 pixels for optimal quality
# Recommended: Create both 1x (120px) and 2x (240px) versions for retina displays
